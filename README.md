# Proof of PPP (Personal Professionalisation Programme)
This repository contains my completed exercises from an online course that I took as a part of PPP. The certificate of completion can be found in the submitted document.

## Online course
As a part of my PPP, I decided to do an online course which focuses on the R programming language. R is a programming language and software environment used primarily for statistical computing, data analysis, and visualization. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, bioinformatics, and finance.

I have opted for a course hosted on Udemy called [The Comprehensive Programming in R Course
](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-comprehensive-programming-in-r-course/) thought by Geoffrey Hubona. The overall course has 14 sections adding up to 25 hours of video lectures with exercises in each section (except section 12).
